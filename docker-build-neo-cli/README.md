This dockerfile was initialized designed in [AshRolls/neo-integration-tests](https://github.com/AshRolls/neo-integration-tests), in a framework designed to test correctness and performance of the Neo blockchain.

Here, a neo-cli client can be easily modified with new parameters from its project or [neo blockchain](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/).
