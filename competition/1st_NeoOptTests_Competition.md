<h1 align="center">The 1st NeoOptTests Competition - Moving towards statistical comprehension</h1>

## What is it

Counting with the support and assistance of NeoResearch team, we announce the first statistical and optimization competition, in which, 600 NEO will be awarded.

The focus of this competition will be limited to awarding high quality statical reports, focused on Neo blockchain bottlenecks and interesting time aspects.
However, participants are encouraged to go further. We do not discard the possibility of increasing the reward for outstanding findings.

## Competition infrasctruture

Basically, the competition will run in two different rounds:

* R1) First innovation round:
  - Participants are encouraged to use [NeoResearch/NeoOptTests](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neo-opt-tests) framework for playing with proof-of-bullets tests and report their finding. However, other types of analyses are welcomed.
  - 2 NEO will be awarded to the best 50 reports
* R2) Replications I
  - Our team will revise all entries and forward crossed experiments to be replicated by participants, at least, two different batch of experiments may reach each participant.
  - 4 NEO will be awarded to the best 50 reports

Finally, the three best reports will be awarded with 100 NEOs.
Outstanding incentives and other prizes may also be awarded.

In each of these two rounds, participants are encouraged to released their researching spirit, being critic and, at the same time, ["blinded"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment).
